# Cursor AI Development Rules

## Live Server Configuration
- Development server runs on http://localhost:8000 (Python) or http://localhost:3000 (Node.js)
- Main presentation file: zappts-AI-as-a-service.html
- Access presentation at: http://localhost:8000/zappts-AI-as-a-service.html

## Project Structure
- HTML presentations are self-contained with embedded CSS/JS
- Theme files in /themes/ directory (SCSS source, CSS compiled)
- Build script: build-theme.js for theme compilation

## Development Workflow
1. Start live server: `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx live-server --port=3000`
2. Open browser to view presentation
3. Edit HTML file and refresh browser to see changes
4. For theme changes: run `npm run build` or `npm run watch`

## Testing Behavior
- Presentation uses Marpit framework with Bespoke.js
- Supports presenter view, fullscreen, and navigation
- Interactive elements: slide navigation, fragments, transitions
- Test responsive behavior and animations in browser

## Common Issues
- CORS issues: Use live server instead of file:// protocol
- Theme not updating: Rebuild themes with `npm run build`
- Navigation not working: Check browser console for JS errors
